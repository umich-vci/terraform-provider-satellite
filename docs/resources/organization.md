# satellite_organization (Resource)

Resource to manage a Red Hat Satellite organization.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "satellite_organization" "foo" {
  name  = "foo"
  label = "foo"
}

resource "satellite_organization" "foo" {
  name = "foo"

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      // label defaults to the same as name in the API
      // However since we didn't explicitly set it it needs to be ignored
      // so that the resource isn't constantly destroyed and recreated.
      label,
    ]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the organization.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description of the organization.
- `label` (String) The label of the organization. If not set, Satellite will use the `name` as the label.  This field can only be set at creation time. If not being set explicitly you will probably want to use `ignore_changes` on this in the lifecycle block.

### Read-Only

- `hosts_count` (Number) A count of how many hosts are registered to the organization.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `title` (String) The title of the organization.
